# ADR: Snowpark Python — Universal Driver Integration

**Branch:** `universal-driver-compat`
**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Context

`snowflake-connector-python` (the traditional Python connector, v4.x) is being superseded by the **Universal Driver** (`snowflake-connector-python-ud`, v2026.0.0). The Universal Driver exposes the same `snowflake.connector` Python namespace but is built on a Rust core (`sf_core`) with Cython/ctypes Python bindings.

The goal of this work is to:
1. Validate that Snowpark Python works correctly with the Universal Driver.
2. Fix pre-existing test infrastructure issues that prevent `pytest` from collecting tests.
3. Establish a CI pipeline that builds the Universal Driver from source and runs the full Snowpark test suite against it.

---

## Decision Log

### 2026-03-09 — Submodule strategy

**Decision:** Add `universal-driver` as a git submodule with relative URL `../universal-driver` at path `universal-driver/`.

**Rationale:** The relative URL resolves to `snowflakedb/universal-driver` on GitHub (same org), so `actions/checkout` with `submodules: true` picks it up automatically in CI without requiring extra secrets or SSH keys. Locally, the submodule directory is replaced with a symlink to the existing checkout at `/home/fpawlowski/repo/universal-driver` to avoid a redundant clone. The symlink is added to `.gitignore` so git does not attempt to track it as a file; the submodule reference is tracked via `.gitmodules` and the commit SHA in the index.

---

### 2026-03-09 — Datasource collection errors — two-part fix

**Decision:** (a) Append stub empty-dict names to `tests/parameters.py`; (b) use `--ignore=tests/integ/datasource` for local runs.

**Rationale:** Several test files in `tests/integ/datasource/` do a top-level `from tests.parameters import MYSQL_CONNECTION_PARAMETERS` that fails at collection when the names are absent. Additionally, `tests/resources/test_data_source_dir/test_jdbc_data.py` subscripts the dicts at module load (`ORACLEDB_CONNECTION_PARAMETERS["host"]` etc.), which cannot be made safe by stubs alone. The real values are injected in CI by `decrypt_parameters.sh`. Locally: (a) stubs make the names importable for any non-datasource test that references them, and (b) `--ignore=tests/integ/datasource` prevents the `test_jdbc_data.py` module-level subscript from running. In CI the datasource directory is not ignored — the full real parameters are available.

**Stub parameters added to `tests/parameters.py`:**
- `DATABRICKS_CONNECTION_PARAMETERS = {}`
- `MYSQL_CONNECTION_PARAMETERS = {}`
- `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_PARAMETERS = {}`
- `ORACLEDB_CONNECTION_PARAMETERS = {}`
- `SQL_SERVER_CONNECTION_PARAMETERS = {}`

### 2026-03-09 — Fix OpenTelemetry collection errors

**Decision:** Guard OTel imports at module level in two test files.

**`tests/integ/test_open_telemetry.py`:** Had unconditional `from opentelemetry import trace` at module level — fails before any `pytestmark` skip markers can apply. Fixed by wrapping in `try/except ImportError` with `pytest.skip(..., allow_module_level=True)`.

**`tests/integ/test_external_telemetry.py`:** Had a `try/except` around the OTel imports that set `dependencies_missing = True` on failure, but class definitions `MockOTLPLogExporter(OTLPLogExporter)` and `MockOTLPSpanExporter(OTLPSpanExporter)` appeared unconditionally at module scope — causing `NameError` when the imports failed. Fixed by guarding the class definitions with `if not dependencies_missing:`.

---

### 2026-03-09 — Baseline test counts (pre-connector-swap)

Command: `uv run pytest tests/unit -q --tb=no`
**Unit tests:** 2601 passed, 3 failed (pre-existing), 21 skipped, 5 xfailed

Command: `uv run pytest tests/integ --ignore=tests/integ/modin --ignore=tests/integ/datasource -q --tb=no`
**Integration tests (excl. modin + datasource):** 3540 errors (all connection errors — no live Snowflake locally), 104 skipped, 39 xfailed

Note: 3 pre-existing unit failures in `test_packaging_utils.py` (`test_get_downloaded_packages_for_real_python_packages`, `test_pip_timeout`, `test_valid_pip_install`) are unrelated to connector version. Integ "errors" are all `SnowflakeLoginException`/connection failures, not test logic failures.

---

### 2026-03-09 — Connector swap strategy

**Decision:** Install Snowpark normally (which pulls in the old connector as a dependency), then:
```
uv pip uninstall snowflake-connector-python -y
uv pip install <universal-driver-wheel>
```

**Rationale:** The Universal Driver is published under a different PyPI package name (`snowflake-connector-python-ud`) but occupies the same `snowflake.connector` Python namespace. Snowpark's `setup.py` has the constraint `>=3.17.0, <5.0.0` targeting `snowflake-connector-python` by name. After the swap, pip metadata is technically inconsistent (snowpark "requires" a package that isn't installed), but the Python runtime works because `snowflake.connector` is present via the UD package. No `setup.py` change is needed at this stage; a follow-up PR should add an `OR` alternative once the UD is on PyPI.

---

### 2026-03-09 — GitHub Actions workflow

**Decision:** Created dedicated workflow `.github/workflows/test-with-universal-driver.yml`. Revised to `workflow_dispatch`-only (no nightly schedule), following the snowflake-cli `ud-manual-tests.yaml` pattern.

**Key aspects:**
- Workflow name: `Run UD tests (manual)`. Triggered exclusively via `workflow_dispatch` — no nightly cron.
- Inputs: `universal_driver_ref` (branch/tag/SHA, default `main`), `python-version` (choice: 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13, default 3.10), `cloud-provider` (choice: aws/azure/gcp, default aws).
- `permissions: contents: read` and `persist-credentials: false` on all checkouts.
- Builds the UD wheel from source in CI using Rust 1.89.0 + Cython + hatchling.
- Caches Cargo registry and `universal-driver/target/` keyed on `Cargo.lock` hash for speed.
- Uses the same `decrypt_parameters.sh` script as the existing precommit workflow so datasource tests receive real credentials.
- Runs the same `tox -e py<ver>-notdoctest-ci` and `tox -e datasource` steps as the existing precommit.
- Two-job split (build wheel → test) is kept because Rust compilation is expensive and reusable; snowflake-cli's single-job approach works because it installs via `git+https://...` inline rather than pre-building.

### 2026-03-10 — Tox venv connector swap (root cause + fix)

**Observation:** The earlier connector swap (Phase 3 above) uninstalled the old connector and installed the UD wheel at the system-Python level. This had no effect on tox runs because tox creates its own isolated virtualenv and re-installs all deps from PyPI via `tox_install_cmd.sh`, overwriting the system-level change.

**Conclusion:** The connector swap must happen *inside* the tox venv, not before it.

**Fix — `scripts/tox_install_cmd.sh`:**
Added a new branch keyed on `ud_connector_path` env var:
```bash
if [[ -n "${ud_connector_path}" ]]; then
  uv pip install ${uv_options[@]}          # install all deps (pulls old connector)
  uv pip uninstall snowflake-connector-python
  uv pip install "${ud_connector_path}"    # replace with UD wheel or git+https URL
fi
```
`ud_connector_path` is passed in by the caller (either a local wheel path or a `git+https://` URL). When unset, behaviour is unchanged.

**Fix — `tox.ini`:**
Added `ud_connector_path` to `passenv` (line ~118) so tox forwards the env var into the venv install step.

**Verification (observation):** After the fix, the tox venv shows `snowflake-connector-python-ud==0.1.0` and the old `snowflake-connector-python` package is absent. Tests proceed until they hit UD API errors rather than silently using the old connector.

---

### 2026-03-10 — CI workflow hardening

**`test-with-universal-driver.yml` changes:**

1. **Dynamic wheel path resolution** — replaced hardcoded `ud-dist/snowflake_connector_python_ud-2026.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` with a step that resolves the path dynamically via `ls ud-dist/*.whl | head -1 → $GITHUB_OUTPUT`. Hardcoded name would break silently when the UD version string changes.

2. **UD ref checkout** — added step to `git -C universal-driver fetch origin && git -C universal-driver checkout origin/${{ inputs.universal_driver_ref }}` when the input is non-empty and non-`main`. Without this, the submodule was always pinned to the committed SHA regardless of the `universal_driver_ref` workflow input.

3. **Connector swap moved into tox** — removed standalone "Install snowpark + swap connector" step; the swap now happens inside tox via `ud_connector_path` passthrough.

**`ud-inline-tests.yml` changes:**

1. **`pull_request` trigger** — added as a secondary trigger (with a TODO comment noting it requires self-hosted runner access). Without a default-value mechanism, the `setup-python` action would receive an empty string for `python-version` on `pull_request` events (no `inputs.*` available), causing it to fall back to the system Python 3.12.3 (externally managed), and `uv pip install` would subsequently fail with `--system` conflicts.

2. **Workflow-level `env:` block** — added to provide defaults for all three matrix dimensions:
   ```yaml
   env:
     PYTHON_VERSION: ${{ inputs.python-version || '3.10' }}
     CLOUD_PROVIDER: ${{ inputs.cloud-provider || 'aws' }}
     UD_BRANCH: ${{ inputs.ud-branch || 'main' }}
   ```
   All steps reference `${{ env.PYTHON_VERSION }}` etc.

3. **Git credentials step** — replaced the "Install snowpark" + "Swap connector" steps with a "Configure git credentials" step that sets up `SNOWFLAKE_GITHUB_TOKEN` for `git+https://` installs. The UD is installed via `ud_connector_path: "git+https://github.com/snowflakedb/universal-driver@${{ env.UD_BRANCH }}#subdirectory=python"` passed into tox.

---

### 2026-03-10 — Compatibility branch selection

**Observation:** The UD `main` branch exposes the new Rust-native API. Several existing Snowflake ecosystem projects (snowflake-cli, snowfort) depend on legacy `snowflake.connector` symbols (`execute_string`, `DictCursor`, `SnowflakeConnection`, `fetchmany`, `config_manager`, `SnowflakeRestful`, `split_statements`, `compat.py`, `constants.py` enums, key-pair auth) that the UD `main` branch does not yet expose.

**Hypothesis (confirmed):** A compatibility-focused UD branch exists that backfills these symbols as thin wrappers over the Rust core.

**Finding:** Branch `turbaszek-ecosystem-compatibility-cli` on `snowflakedb/universal-driver` (24 commits ahead of `main` at time of writing) adds:
- `execute_string`, `execute_stream`
- `DictCursor`, `SnowflakeConnection` alias
- `fetchmany`, `config_manager`, `SnowflakeRestful`, `split_statements`
- `compat.py`, `constants.py` enums
- Key-pair auth

**Decision:** Created `snowpark-compatibility` branch in the `universal-driver` submodule, branching from `turbaszek-ecosystem-compatibility-cli`. This is the branch used for all local test runs and future CI targeting. Reason for a separate branch rather than tracking the upstream directly: lets us add snowpark-specific patches without polluting the upstream compat branch.

**Notable difference from `main`:** This branch uses `rustls = { version = "0.23.20", features = ["aws_lc_rs"] }` (same as main, no `"fips"` feature). Also carries `openssl = "0.10.73"` and `jwt = { version = "0.16.0", features = ["openssl"] }` as direct dependencies in `sf_core/Cargo.toml`, which link dynamically against the system's `libssl.so.3`.

### 2026-03-10 — Local wheel build: environment issues and fixes

#### Issue 1: FIPS delocator (resolved — not applicable to this branch)

**Hypothesis (wrong):** The `turbaszek-ecosystem-compatibility-cli` branch enables the `fips` feature on `rustls`, pulling in `aws-lc-fips-sys` which requires a Go-based delocator tool. On aarch64 Amazon/Rocky Linux with devtoolset-10 GCC 10.2.1, the delocator produces `parse error near WS` on the generated assembly.

**Correction:** The `snowpark-compatibility` branch (`turbaszek-ecosystem-compatibility-cli` base) does **not** have `"fips"` in `rustls` features and `aws-lc-fips-sys` is absent from `Cargo.lock`. This issue does not apply. The hypothesis was formed while investigating an earlier branch state.

#### Issue 2: `cmake` not found inside `uv run` subprocess

**Observation:** Running `uv run --with hatch ... hatch build` failed with `Missing dependency: cmake`. `/usr/bin/cmake` exists on the system but is not on the `PATH` visible to the `cargo` subprocess spawned from within `uv`'s isolated environment on Rocky Linux 9.7.

**Fix:** Pass `CMAKE=/usr/bin/cmake` as an explicit env var (the `aws-lc-sys` build script checks `$CMAKE` before searching `PATH`). Added to `scripts/build_ud_connector.sh`:
```bash
CMAKE="${CMAKE:-$(command -v cmake 2>/dev/null)}" \
  uv run --with hatch --with cython --with setuptools hatch build
```
On systems where cmake is on PATH (e.g. Ubuntu CI), `command -v cmake` resolves it and the env var is a no-op.

**Outcome (observation):** Wheel built successfully:
```
dist/snowflake_connector_python_ud-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
Contains `libsf_core.so` (55 MB unstripped release build) and `arrow_stream_iterator.cpython-310-aarch64-linux-gnu.so`. The `py3-none-any` tag is cosmetic — hatchling doesn't auto-tag platform wheels when binaries are injected via build hooks.

#### Issue 3: `libssl.so.3` not found at runtime (OPEN)

**Observation:** After installing the wheel into the tox venv, importing `snowflake.connector` fails with `RuntimeError: Couldn't load core driver dependency`. Root cause: `libsf_core.so` was compiled against system OpenSSL 3.5.1 (`/lib64/libssl.so.3`) because `openssl-sys` detects it via pkg-config. The tox venv uses the nix-managed Python interpreter (`/opt/sfc/python3.10`), which runs with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` pointing exclusively to nix store paths. Those paths contain only OpenSSL 1.1.x (`libssl.so.1.1`), not 3.x.

**Hypothesis A (tested, failed):** Add `/lib64` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Result: nix bash (glibc 2.34) collides with system `libc.so.6` (requires GLIBC_2.35) — the two glibc stacks cannot be mixed.

**Hypothesis B (tested, failed):** `OPENSSL_STATIC=1` during cargo build. Result: linker still emits `-Wl,-Bdynamic -lssl -lcrypto`. `OPENSSL_STATIC=1` did not propagate into the `openssl-sys` build script subprocess. Static `.a` files may also be absent.

**Hypothesis C (not yet tested):** `RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-Wl,-rpath,/lib64"` embeds `/lib64` into the `.so` RPATH. Since RPATH is consulted before `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, this would let nix Python find `libssl.so.3` without mixing glibc stacks.

**Hypothesis D (not yet tested):** Copy `libssl.so.3` and `libcrypto.so.3` from `/lib64` into the wheel's `_core/` directory next to `libsf_core.so`. The existing `$ORIGIN` RPATH would find them. Avoids any rebuild. Requires bundling ~5 MB of system libs in the local wheel; CI wheels are built on Ubuntu where this issue does not arise.

**Open question:** Which of C or D is the right fix? D is simpler for local dev but potentially violates OpenSSL licensing/distribution expectations if the wheel were ever published. C is cleaner but requires a rebuild.

### 2026-03-11 — Env fixes: libssl.so.3 (resolved), GLIBCXX_3.4.29 (resolved), missing symbols (resolved)

#### libssl.so.3 — Hypothesis D confirmed

**Conclusion:** Copying `/lib64/libssl.so.3` and `/lib64/libcrypto.so.3` into the wheel's `_core/` directory resolves the `RuntimeError: Couldn't load core driver dependency` failure. The `$ORIGIN` RPATH on `libsf_core.so` causes the dynamic linker to find the bundled copies before consulting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Implemented in `scripts/build_ud_connector.sh` as a conditional post-build step (no-op on Ubuntu CI where `libssl.so.3` is on the default search path).

**Note:** `libssl.so.3` and `libcrypto.so.3` require GLIBC up to 2.34; the nix Python uses GLIBC_2.34, so no collision.

#### GLIBCXX_3.4.29 — new blocker (resolved via LD_PRELOAD)

**Observation:** After libssl was fixed, the next error was:
```
ImportError: /nix/store/.../gcc-9.3.0-lib/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.29' not found
(required by snowflake/connector/_internal/arrow_stream_iterator.cpython-310-aarch64-linux-gnu.so)
```

**Root cause (observation):** `arrow_stream_iterator.so` was compiled against the system GCC (GLIBCXX_3.4.29). The nix Python environment loads the nix gcc-9.3.0 libstdc++ first (via pyarrow importing it), which only has GLIBCXX up to 3.4.28. The `$ORIGIN` trick is ineffective here because `libstdc++.so.6` is already loaded in the process image before `arrow_stream_iterator.so` is imported.

**$ORIGIN approach (hypothesis E, tested, failed):** Copying `/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6` into `_internal/` alongside the .so did not help — the already-loaded nix version wins the soname race.

**Fix (hypothesis F — confirmed):** `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6` forces the system libstdc++ to be loaded before the nix Python environment loads its own. The system `libstdc++.so.6` requires GLIBC_2.34 (not 2.35), so no glibc collision occurs. Implemented in `scripts/run_tests_with_ud.sh` (conditional, no-op where `/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6` is absent) and `LD_PRELOAD` added to `passenv` in `tox.ini`.

#### Missing Python symbols — resolved

**Observation:** After env fixes, Snowpark could not be imported due to missing symbols in the UD connector. Full list resolved in the `snowpark-compatibility` branch:

| Symbol | File | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| `ASYNC_RETRY_PATTERN` | `cursor.py` | Added constant `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10]` |
| `ResultMetadata` | `cursor.py` | Added NamedTuple |
| `ResultMetadataV2` | `cursor.py` | Added as alias for `ResultMetadata` |
| `FIELD_ID_TO_NAME`, `ENV_VAR_PARTNER`, `UTF8` | `constants.py` | Added |
| `OK` | `compat.py` | Added (`http.client.OK`) |
| `MissingDependencyError` | `errors.py` | Added |
| `options.py` | new | `installed_pandas`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `MissingOptionalDependency`, `MissingPandas`, `ModuleLikeObject` |
| `write_pandas`, `_create_temp_stage`, `_create_temp_file_format`, `build_location_helper` | `pandas_tools.py` | New file — stubs (raise NotImplementedError except `build_location_helper`) |
| `ReauthenticationRequest` | `network.py` | New file |
| `SecretDetector` | `secret_detector.py` | New file — minimal masking formatter |
| `TelemetryService` | `telemetry_oob.py` | New file — singleton stub (all calls no-op) |
| `VERSION` | `version.py` | New file — `(0, 1, 0, None)` tuple |

**Turbaszek check:** `turbaszek-ecosystem-compatibility-cli` did not have `options.py`, `pandas_tools.py`, `network.py`, `secret_detector.py`, `telemetry_oob.py`, or `version.py`. All written fresh. `turbaszek-python-missing-api` had `ResultMetadata` and `version.py` — `ResultMetadata` pattern was borrowed from there.

#### Test collection result — definition of done met

**Observation:**
```
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 pytest tests/unit --ignore=tests/unit/modin
→ 1767 tests collected in 0.80s
→ 499 passed, 1 xfailed, 1 error (first API failure)
```

**Conclusion:** Tests collect and execute. First real API failure:
```
AttributeError: Mock object has no attribute 'session_id'
  at snowflake.snowpark._internal.server_connection.ServerConnection.get_session_id
  at tests/unit/conftest.py::mock_server_connection
```
This is a real API incompatibility — Snowpark's unit test fixtures create `ServerConnection` with a `MagicMock` in place of a `SnowflakeConnection`. The UD's `Connection` object has a different attribute layout than the old connector (missing `session_id`).

---

## Open Items

- [ ] **Phase 6 — API compatibility:** Fix `AttributeError: Mock object has no attribute 'session_id'` and subsequent API failures in `ServerConnection`. First step: check whether UD's `Connection` exposes `session_id` or what its equivalent is.
- [ ] Rebuild wheel before each test run (or automate reinstall in `run_tests_with_ud.sh`).
- [ ] Add `snowflake-connector-python-ud` as an alternative dependency in `setup.py` once UD is on PyPI.
- [ ] Validate modin tests with Universal Driver (Phase 7).
- [ ] Decide whether `snowpark-compatibility` branch should track `turbaszek-ecosystem-compatibility-cli` upstream or diverge with snowpark-specific patches.
