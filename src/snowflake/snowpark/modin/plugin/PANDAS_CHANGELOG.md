## 1.16.0a1 (tbd)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug when creating a DataFrame with a dict of Series objects.
- Fixed issues with concat with index and column alignment that impacted datasets loaded from file
- Fixed support for `display.max_rows` and `display.max_cols` being set to `None`.
- Fixed incorrect return type in `qcut` when given `Series` input and improved error checking logic.
- Fixed bug when performing multiple DataFrameGroupBy apply/transform operations on the same DataFrame.

### Behavior Changes
- Given an input of type `Series`, `pd.qcut` always returns a `Series`.
- `pd.qcut` produces `NotImplementedError` whenever `labels is not False` instead of falling back to pandas itself.

### Improvements
- Improved performance for `Series.quantile` and `Series.describe`. 
- Improved `DataFrame.quantile` and `DataFrame.describe` for one-column `DataFrame`s.
- Improved performance of `pd.qcut` by removing joins in generated sql query.

### New Features
- Added partial support for `SeriesGroupBy.apply` (where the `SeriesGrouBy` is obtained through `DataFrameGroupBy.__getitem__`).

## 1.15.0a1 (2024-05-03)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed overriding of subclasses' property docstrings for modin issue https://github.com/modin-project/modin/issues/7113.
- Fixed `@udf` decorator when `packages=None` is specified thus preventing an error in `Series.apply`.
- Fixed incorrect regex used in `Series.str.contains`.
- Fixed DataFrame's `__getitem__` with a boolean DataFrame key.
- Fixed incorrect regex used in `DataFrame/Series.replace`.
- Fixed AssertionError in `Series.sort_values` after repr and indexing operations are performed.
- Fixed the UDTF "int64 is not serializable" errors from new Snowflake release in `apply(axis=1)`.
- Fixed binary operations with single-row DataFrame and Series.

### Behavior Changes
- Raise not implemented error instead of fallback to pandas in the following APIs:
  - `pd.merge`, `DataFrame.merge` and `DataFrame.join` if given the `validate` parameter.
  - `pd.to_numeric` if `error == 'ignore'`.
  - `pd.to_datetime` if `format` is None or not supported in Snowflake or if `exact`, `infer_datetime_format` parameters are given or `origin == 'julian'` or `error == 'ignore'`.
  - `DataFrame/Series.all` if called on non-integer/boolean columns.
  - `DataFrame/Series.any` if called on non-integer/boolean columns.
  - `DataFrame/Series.astype` if casting from string to datetime or `errors == 'ignore'`.
  - `DataFrame/Series.dropna` if `axis == 1`.
  - `DataFrame/Series.mask` if given `axis` or `level` parameters.
  - `DataFrame/Series.rename` if `mapper` is callable or the DataFrame/Series has MultiIndex.
  - `DataFrame/Series.sort_values` if given the `key` parameter.
  - `DataFrame/Series.sort_index` if given the `key` parameter.
  - `DataFrame.nunique` if `axis == 1`.
  - `DataFrame.apply` if `axis == 0` or `func` is not callable or `result_type` is given or `args` and `kwargs` contain DataFrame or Series.
  - `Series.apply` if `axis == 0` or `func` is not callable or `result_type` is given.
  - `Series.applymap` if `na_action == 'ignore'`.
  - `DataFrame/Series.ffill` if given the `limit` or `downcast` parameter.
  - `DataFrame/Series.fillna` if given the `limit` or `downcast` parameter.
  - `dot` binary operation between `DataFrame/Series`.
  - `xor` binary operation between `DataFrame/Series`.
  - All `DataFrame/Series.groupby` operations if either `axis == 1`, both `by` and `level` are configured, or `by` contains any non-pandas hashable labels.
  - Series datetime accessor properties and methods `Series.dt.*`.
  - Always include the missing attribute (method, classmethod, or property) name when raising NotImplementedError.
  - `casefold`, `cat`, `decode`, `split`, `rsplit`, `get`, `join`, `get_dummies`, `pad`, `center`, `ljust`, `rjust`, `zfill`, `wrap`, `slice`, `slice_replace`, `encode`, `findall`, `match`, `extract`, `extractall`, `rstrip`, `lstrip`, `partition`, `removeprefix`, `removesuffix`, `repeat`, `rpartition`, `find`, `rfind`, `index`, `rindex`, `swapcase`, `normalize`, `translate`, `isalnum`, `isalpha`, `isspace`, `isnumeric`, and `isdecimal` for `Series.str`.
- Removed `Series.dt.week` and `Series.dt.weekofyear` to align Snowpark pandas with the pandas 2.2.1 API.
- In pandas 2.2.x, `df.loc` and `__setitem__` have buggy behavior in the following scenarios:
  - A column key is used to assign a DataFrame item to a DataFrame (a scalar column key and DataFrame item are used for assignment (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/58482)).
  - The column key has duplicates in a specific manner (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/58317), or
  - A new row and column are used in the row and column keys (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/58316).
  Snowpark pandas deviates from this behavior and will maintain the same behavior as pandas from versions 1.5.x.
- Changed the import path of Snowpark pandas package to use Modin 0.28.1 instead. The new recommended import statement is `import modin.pandas as pd; import snowflake.snowpark.modin.plugin`.

## 1.14.0a2 (2024-04-18)

### Behavior Changes
- The `to_pandas` operation converts all integers to int64, instead of int8, int16 etc. To get an exact type, the user needs to explicitly specify precision values for their Snowflake column. This is a general behavior change across all of Snowpark.
- The following API changes are made to align Snowpark pandas with the pandas 2.2.1 API:
  - Updated DateOffset strings to pandas 2.2.1 versions.
  - As part of this transition, we have a set of transitional API and test bugs:
    - SNOW-1320623 - `df.loc` with column keys duplicated or extra fails.
    - SNOW-1320660 - `qcut` / `cut` with bin preparation is temporarily NotImplemented due to upstream changes.
    - SNOW-1321662 - `merge` fails when join is outer and sort is False.
    - SNOW-1321682 - `df.melt` w/ duplicated cols.
    - SNOW-1318223 - `series.py::_flex_method` list-like other (`pd.Index`) may not be supported in pandas now.
    - SNOW-1321719 - `test_bitwise_operators.py` xfails.
- Changed the dtype of the index of empty `DataFrame` and `Series` to be `int64` rather than `object` to match the behavior of pandas.

### New Features
- Added support for `axis` argument for `df.where` and `df.mask` when `other` is a Series.
- Added back `_repr_html_` to DataFrame class for pretty printing (partially reverts commit 576ba26586caca3fa063da1fed465c61091b6d9c).
- Added support for `DataFrameGroupBy.nunique`.

## 1.14.0a1 (2024-04-11)

### Behavior Changes
- The following API changes are made to align Snowpark pandas with the pandas 2.1.4 API:
  - Removed `errors` and `try_cast` arguments from `DataFrame`/`Series.where` and `mask`.
  - Added the `dtype_backend` argument to `DataFrame`/`Series.convert_dtypes`; this argument is ignored by Snowpark pandas and only exists for compatibility.
  - Removed `is_copy` from `DataFrame`/`Series.take`.
  - Removed `squeeze` argument from `DataFrame`/`Series.groupby`. Changed the default value of `group_keys` to `True`, and `observed` to `no_default`.
  - Limited the length of generated labels and identifiers to 32 characters
  - Removed the `squeeze`, `prefix`, `mangle_dupe_cols`, `error_bad_lines`, and `warn_bad_lines` arguments from `pd.read_csv`. These were previously unsupported by Snowpark pandas, and existed only for compatibility.
  - Renamed the `skip_initial_space` argument in `pd.read_csv` to `skipinitialspace`; it remains unsupported and will raise an error if specified.
  - Added the `date_format` and `dtype_backend` arguments in `pd.read_csv`. These are currently unsupported and added only for compatibility. `dtype_backend` is ignored and will raise a warning if provided, and `date_format` will raise an error.
  - Added the `dtype_backend`, `filesystem`, and `filters` arguments in `pd.read_parquet`. These are currently unsupported and added only for compatibility. `dtype_backend` is ignored and will raise a warning if provided, and `filesystem` and `filters` will raise an error.
  - Removed the `numpy` argument from `pd.read_json`. This was previously unsupported, and existed only for compatibility.
  - Added the `dtype_backend` and `engine` arguments to `pd.read_json`. These are currently unsupported and added only for compatibility; they are ignored and will raise a warning if provided.

- The following methods are removed:
  - `DataFrame`/`Series.append`
  - `Series.is_monotonic`

### New Features
- Added support for `pd.cut` with `retbins=False` and `labels=False`.
- Added support for `Series.str.strip`.
- Added support for `Series.str.len`.
- Added support for `Series.str.capitalize`.

- Added support for `DataFrameGroupby.head` and `DataFrameGroupBy.tail`.
- Added support for `DataFrameGroupBy.idxmax` and `DataFrameGroupBy.idxmin` for `GroupBy` `axis = 0`.
- Updated to `snowpark-python` v1.14.0.
- Updated to `pandas` 2.2.1 from 2.1.4.
- Added support for `axis` argument for `df.where` and `df.mask` when `other` is a Series.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed broadcast when masking a DataFrame with a Series using `df.where` or `df.mask`.
- Error out when scalar is passed for condition to DataFrame/Series `where` or `mask`.
- Fixed property docstring generation for some classes that use the telemetry metaclass.
- Fixed an issue where creating a Snowpark pandas DataFrame from a Series with a tuple `name`, such as `pd.DataFrame(pd.Series(name=("A", 1)))`, did not create `MultiIndex` columns on the resulting frame.
- Added custom docstrings inplace to avoid module reload errors.
- Added a separate docstring class for BasePandasDataset.
- Fixed docstring overrides for subclasses.

## 1.13.0a1 (2024-03-15)
### Dependency Updates
- Upgraded `pandas` from 1.5.3 to 2.1.4.

### Behavior Changes
- Removed support for Python 3.8, as pandas 2.1.4 no longer supports this version. Please upgrade your environment to use Python 3.9 or newer.
- The following API changes are made as a result of moving from pandas 1.5.3 to 2.1.4:
  - Removed sized index types like `pd.Int64Index` and `pd.Float64Index`. Index objects are now explicitly constructed with a dtype parameter.
  - Changed the default dtype of an empty Series from `float64` to `object`.
  - Changed the default value of `numeric_only` to `False` for many operations. Previously, setting `numeric_only=None` would automatically drop non-numeric columns from a frame if possible; this behavior has been removed, and setting `numeric_only=None` gives the same behavior as `numeric_only=False`.
  - Removed the `level` parameter from aggregation functions (`sum`, `prod`, `count`, `any`, etc.).
  - Removed `Series.append`. Use `pd.concat` instead.
  - Removed the `inplace` parameter for `set_axis`.
  - Removed the `datetime_is_numeric` parameter for `describe`. All datetime data is now treated as numeric.
  - Removed the `loffset` and `base` parameters for `resample` and `Grouper`. Use `offset` and `origin` instead.
  - Added a name to the output of `value_counts`. The returned series will be named `count` when `normalize=False`, and `proportion` when `normalize=True`.
- The following errors have changed as a result of moving from pandas 1.5.3 to 2.1.4:
  - When attempting to call `DataFrame.aggregate` with a dict where a label has no associated functions (e.g. `df.aggregate({0: []})`), the error message has changed from "no result" to "No objects to concatenate."
  - Calling aggregation methods with `numeric_only=True` on non-numeric `Series` objects raises a `TypeError`.
  - Calling `DataFrame.aggregate` or `Series.aggregate` with a list of aggregations will not raise an error when invalid keyword arguments are passed. For example, `df.agg(["count"], invalid=0)` will not raise an error in Snowpark pandas even though "invalid" is not a valid argument to the `count` aggregation.
  - Calling `GroupBy.shift` with a non-integer value for the `periods` argument now always raises a `TypeError`. Previously, floating point values that happened to be integers (like `2.0` or `-2.0`) were valid.
  - Stopped automatically creating a Snowpark session when there is no active Snowpark session. Instead, Snowpark pandas requires a unique active Snowpark session.

### New Features
- Added `"quantile"` as a valid aggregation in `DataFrame.agg` and `Series.agg`.
- Added support for binary operations between `DataFrame`/`Series` and `Series`/`DataFrame` along `axis=1`.

- Added support for `Series.str.startswith` and `Series.str.endswith`.
- Added support for reading SQL Queries with CTEs and CTEs with anonymous stored procedures into a `DataFrame` object via `pd.read_snowflake`.
- Added support for `DataFrame.first_valid_index`, `DataFrame.last_valid_index`, `Series.first_valid_index`, and `Series.last_valid_index`.
- Added support for `DataFrame.ffill`, `DataFrame.pad`, `Series.ffill`, and, `Series.pad`.
- Added support for reading `CALL SQL` Queries into a `DataFrame` object via `pd.read_snowflake`.
- Added support for `Series.str.lower` and `Series.str.upper`.
- Added support for `Series.str.isdigit`, `Series.str.islower`, and `Series.str.isupper`.
- Added partial support for `DataFrameGroupBy.apply` on `axis=0`, for `func` returning a `DataFrame`.
- Added partial support for `DataFrameGroupBy.apply` on `axis=0`, for `func` returning an object that is neither a DataFrame nor a Series.
- Added support for `Series.groupby.cumcount`, `Series.groupby.cummax`, `Series.groupby.cummin`,  and `Series.groupby.cumsum`.
- Added support for `DataFrame.groupby.cumcount`, `DataFrame.groupby.cummax`, `DataFrame.groupby.cummin`,  and `DataFrame.groupby.cumsum`.
- Added support for `pd.qcut` with `retbins=False`.
- Added support for `Series.str.contains` and `Series.str.count`.
- Added partial support for `DataFrameGroupBy.apply` on `axis=0`, for `func` always returning a `Series` with the same index and same name.
- Added support for `DataFrameGroupBy.rank` and `SeriesGroupBy.rank`.

### Bug Fixes
- Allowed getting the Snowpark pandas session before creating a Snowpark pandas Dataframe or Series.
- Fixed an issue when using `pd.read_snowflake` together with `apply(..., axis=1)` where the row position column could not be disambiguated.
- Fixed the exception that you get when accessing a missing attribute of the Snowpark pandas module.
- Using dataframe or series apply(axis=1) when there are multiple sessions no longer raises an exception.
- Added docstring and doctests to correctly reflect difference between Snowpark pandas and native pandas functionality for `get` method.

### Improvements
- Improved performance for `DataFrame.apply` and `Series.apply` for `axis=1` for functions passed without type hints by micro-batching rows.
- Restructure Snowpark pandas documentation

## 1.12.1a1 (2024-02-20)

### New Features

### Behavior Changes
- Deprecated support for Python 3.8. A future release will upgrade the `pandas` version to 2.1.4, which no longer supports Python 3.8. Users should upgrade Python to 3.9 or later.

### Improvements
- Added cleanup logic at interpreter shutdown to close all active sessions.
- Improved performance for `DataFrame.apply` for `axis=1` by relying on Snowflake vectorized UDFs instead of vectorized UDTFs together with dynamic pivot.
