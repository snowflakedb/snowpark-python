This test suite tests scikit-learn's interoperability with Snowpark pandas.

Generally, scikit-learn seems to work with Snowpark pandas inputs via a
combination of the dataframe interchange protocol and converting Snowpark
pandas inputs to numpy with methods like __array__() and np.asarray(). Some
scikit-learn methods may cause Snowpark pandas to execute many Snowflake
queries or to materialize Snowpark pandas data one or more times. We don't
plan to fix the performance of scikit-learn with Snowpark pandas inputs, and
we recommend that users convert their data to native pandas before passing it
to scikit-learn if scikit-learn takes too long with Snowpark pandas inputs.

We group the tests into scenarios into the following use cases, listed under
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html:

- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Model selection
- Preprocessing

Many scikit-learn methods produce non-deterministic results, and not all of
them provide a way to seed the results so that they are consistent for a test.
Generally, we only validate that 1) we can pass Snowpark pandas dataframe/series
into methods that accept native pandas inputs and 2) the outputs have the correct
type and, in case they are numpy arrays, they have the correct shape.

To test interoperability with a particular scikit-learn method:

1) Read about what the method does and how to use it
2) Start writing a test case under the test class for the category that the
   method belongs to (e.g. under TestClassification for
   LinearDiscriminantAnalysis)
2) Construct a use case that works with native pandas and produces a meaningful
   result (for example, train a model on pandas training data and fit it to test
   data)
3) Write a test case checking that replacing the pandas input with Snowpark
   pandas produces results of the same type and, in the case of array-like
   outputs, of the same dimensions. `assert_numpy_results_valid` can validate
   numpy results. Avoid checking that the values in the result are the same
   values we would get if we use pandas, because many scikit-learn methods
   are non-deterministic.
4) Wrap the test with an empty sql_count_checker() decorator to see how many
   queries and joins it requires. If it it requires a very large number of
   queries, see if you can simplify the test case so that it causes fewer
   queries, so that the test finishes quickly. If you can't reduce the number of
   queries to a reasonable level, you should pass the SQL count checker the
   `no_check=True` parameter because the number of queries is likely to vary
   across scikit-learn and Snowpark pandas versions, and we don't gain much
   insight by adjusting the query count every time it changes.
5) Add a row describing interoperability with the new method in the
   [documentation](docs/source/modin/interoperability.rst)
