# Release History
## 0.4.0 (Unknown)

### New Features
- Added a parameter `session` to function `udf` so you can specify which session to use to create a UDF if you have multiple sessions.

## 0.4.0
### New Features
- Added `Column.within_group()` for sorting the rows by the specified columns with some aggregation functions.
- Added `Table` class, with `update` and `delete` method to update and delete rows of a table in Snowflake.

## 0.3.0 (2022-01-09)
### New Features
- Added `Column.isin()`, with an alias `Column.in_()`.
- Added `Column.try_cast()`, which is a special version of `cast()`. It tries to cast a string expression to other types and returns `null` if the cast is not possible.
- Added `Column.startswith()` and `Column.substr()` to process string columns.
- `Column.cast()` now also accepts a `str` value to indicate the cast type in addition to a `DataType` instance.
- Added `DataFrame.describe()` to summarize stats of a `DataFrame`.
- Added `DataFrame.explain()` to print the query plan of a `DataFrame`.
- `DataFrame.filter()` and `DataFrame.select_expr()` now accepts a sql expression.
- Added a new `bool` parameter `create_temp_table` to methods `DataFrame.saveAsTable()` and `Session.write_pandas()` to optionally create a temp table.
- Added `DataFrame.minus()` and `DataFrame.subtract()` as aliases to `DataFrame.except_()`.
- Added `regexp_replace()`, `concat()`, `concat_ws()`, `to_char()`, `current_timestamp()`, `current_date()`, `current_time()`, `months_between()`, `cast()`, `try_cast()`, `greatest()`, `least()`, and `hash()` to module `snowflake.snowpark.functions`.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where `Session.createDataFrame(pandas_df)` and `Session.write_pandas(pandas_df)` raise an exception when the `Pandas DataFrame` has spaces in the column name.
- `DataFrame.copy_into_table()` sometimes prints an `error` level log entry while it actually works. It's fixed now.
- Fixed an API docs issue where some `DataFrame` APIs are missing from the docs.

### Dependency updates
- Update ``snowflake-connector-python`` to 2.7.2, which upgrades ``pyarrow`` dependency to 6.0.x. Refer to the [python connector 2.7.2 release notes](https://pypi.org/project/snowflake-connector-python/2.7.2/) for more details.

## 0.2.0 (2021-12-02)
### New Features
- Updated the `Session.createDataFrame()` method for creating a `DataFrame` from a Pandas DataFrame.
- Added the `Session.write_pandas()` method for writing a `Pandas DataFrame` to a table in Snowflake and getting a `Snowpark DataFrame` object back.
- Added new classes and methods for calling window functions.
- Added the new functions `cume_dist()`, to find the cumulative distribution of a value with regard to other values within a window partition,
  and `row_number()`, which returns a unique row number for each row within a window partition.
- Added functions for computing statistics for DataFrames in the `DataFrameStatFunctions` class.
- Added functions for handling missing values in a DataFrame in the `DataFrameNaFunctions` class.
- Added new methods `rollup()`, `cube()`, and `pivot()` to the `DataFrame` class.
- Added the `GroupingSets` class, which you can use with the DataFrame groupByGroupingSets method to perform a SQL GROUP BY GROUPING SETS.
- Added the new `FileOperation(session)`
  class that you can use to upload and download files to and from a stage.
- Added the `DataFrame.copy_into_table()`
  method for loading data from files in a stage into a table.
- In CASE expressions, the functions `when()` and `otherwise()`
  now accept Python types in addition to `Column` objects.
- When you register a UDF you can now optionally set the `replace` parameter to `True` to overwrite an existing UDF with the same name.

### Improvements
- UDFs are now compressed before they are uploaded to the server. This makes them about 10 times smaller, which can help
  when you are using large ML model files.
- When the size of a UDF is less than 8196 bytes, it will be uploaded as in-line code instead of uploaded to a stage.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the statement `df.select(when(col("a") == 1, 4).otherwise(col("a"))), [Row(4), Row(2), Row(3)]` raised an exception.
- Fixed an issue where `df.toPandas()` raised an exception when a DataFrame was created from large local data.
