```bash
# OPTIONAL: can skip this step if you are confident that your snowpark 1.25.0 environment works.
# recommend preparing environment beforehand because 1) conda solve is slow 2) some libraries
# are slow the first time they run on a new environment.
# From this location
conda env create --force -y -f demo_py39_1_25_0_before.yml

# Now Run demo_py39_1_25_0_before_empty.ipynb using the environment
# demo-py39-1.25.0-before and use demo_py39_1_25_0_before_full.ipynb as a backup.

# OPTIONAL: can skip this step if you are confident that your snowpark 1.27.0 environment works.
# From this location
conda env create --force -y -f demo_py39_1_27_0_after.yml

# Run demo_py39_1_27_0_before_empty.ipynb using the environment
# demo-py39-1.27.0-after and use demo_py39_1_27_0_after_full.ipynb as a backup.
```



to fix the 1.27.0 env:

```bash
conda env export | grep -v "^prefix: " > demo-third-party-libraries/demo_py39_1_27_0_after.yml
```
